you should put all this files in /home/${youruser}/.config/nvim
also if you have previously installed nvim you should remove your cache too :
`rm -r ~/.local/share/nvim` <br>
`rm -r ~/.cache/nvim` <br>
also you would probably need a nerd font so that the icons of nvim tree works, you can go and get it form https://www.nerdfonts.com/ and install it with this: https://www.debugpoint.com/install-fonts-linux/
